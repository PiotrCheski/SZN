## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PiotrCheski/SZN.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd your-flask-app
```

Create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment. On Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

On macOS and Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

Before running the application, you may need to configure some settings. Most configurations can be found in the `config.py` file.

## Running the Application

Once the installation and configuration steps are complete, you can run the Flask application. Make sure you are in the project directory and your virtual environment is activated.

Run the following command to start the Flask development server:

```bash
python app.py
```

By default, the application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000/` in your web browser.
